# Assignment 5 Questions

Please answer the following questions.  There are no "wrong" answers, but:
  * Some will help us understand your work habits,
  * Some will help us understand your work, and
  * Some may help you identify deficiencies in your work.

***Q1.0 Can you describe any errors or bugs that you found particularly time consuming or challenging?***

We were confused about when should we publish the data and we spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to apply the line of data.

***Q1.1 If applicable, were there any special programming techniques or tools you used to assist you with the bugs/challenges in the previous question?***

The Serial Monitor and console.log are good friends of debugging. When one of us was stuck on a problem we will discuss and usually could find the reasons.

***Q1.2 Errors/bugs are unavoidable, but in hindsight are there any techniques/approaches that you could have used (but didn't) that would have helped you with the bugs/challenges?***

Should have made the previous assignment better since this assignment is built on it.

***Q1.3 Were there any significant misunderstandings (i.e., not a typo) that deterred your progress on this?  If so, can you describe them?***

publish. When we publish too frequently(the same data twice), the data is gone?!

***Q2 Do you have any suggestions that would help future students with this assignment?***

Start Early.

***Q3.0 If you worked in a group, did you use pair programming?***

Yes.

***3.1 If you didn't use pair programming, skip to question 3.2.  If you did, in the following table give each person's name and an estimate of the percent of total time they spent as a "driver":***

| Name  |  % of Time as Driver |
|:------|:---------------------|
|  Victoria Zhang  | 60%                  |
|  Xingjue Liao | 40%                  |

***Q3.2 If you used pair programming, skip this question.  If you didn't, explain how you divided up the work and how each person contributed:***

***Q4. Assignment Checklist.  Below is a Markdown style Task List. The Tasks correspond to many of the major features of the assignment. Filling in the checklist will help ensure that you have completed many of the major elements of the assignment (although it does not cover every point possible)***
